# php-skeleton-app
My personal php skeleton general purpose app

We will use the better repos to build better software.

So, what we will use?

- twig, for template/views engine
- psysh, for better PHP REPL
- phing, for project building
- doctrine, as ORM
- phinx, for database migrations
- php_codesniffer, for check the project code
- fast-route, for routing
- faker, for generate fake data to test        
- phpmd, for detect mess errors in code
- phpstan, for static analyze code checking
- php-cs-fixer, for show/fix code errors
- debugbar, to help you debug what is happening in the application
- monolog, for generating logs
- phpunit, to make unit tests

All this things for you to create a good, maintainable code. It will be a kind of a Framework, but completely decoupled.
